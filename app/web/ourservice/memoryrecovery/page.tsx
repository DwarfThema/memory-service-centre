              According to the forgetting curve theory by German psychologist
              Hermann Ebbinghaus, we can remember only about 58% of something
              we&apos;ve learned after 20 minutes, 33% after a day, and only 21%
              after a month. Research shows that the amount of lost belongings
              that could have been forgotten but were retrieved through
              selective memory retrieval has been reduced to approximately
              one-fifth of what it used to be. This technique is actively
              applied in various fields such as art restoration, criminal
              investigations, and more. Selective memory retrieval is a
              procedure conducted after ensuring there are no potential issues
              during the surgery through brain imaging and passing a
              &apos;memory equivalence test.&apos;

                *Selective memory retrieval is an FDA-approved procedure that
                uses the CE-certified electrical stimulation machine NET-X8
                series. Memory retrieval is a procedure that enhances existing
                memories, and it cannot recover memories that do not exist.

                  Memory Recovery Process
                </span>
                First, memories are digitized. Then, small areas in the brain
                where faint memories reside are stimulated with mild electrical
                impulses applied digitally. Synapses between nerve cells are
                stimulated, leading to the recovery of the targeted memories.
