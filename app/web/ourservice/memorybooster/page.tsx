      answer:
        "If you've scheduled an appointment through our [reservation] feature, please make sure to receive an MM code to confirm your appointment at least one week before the actual procedure date. Failure to confirm your appointment will result in cancellation, and memory surgery cannot proceed.",

      question: "Q2. Who is not eligible for surgery?",
      answer:
        "1. Individuals allergic to the contrast agent used for brain imaging. \n2. Patients who have suffered brain damage within the last 6 months due to illness or accidents. \n3. Patients diagnosed with brain-related cancer or receiving treatment within the last 6 months, with confirmed recurrent or metastatic cancer. \n4. Individuals deemed unsuitable for selective memory surgery for other reasons.",

              Modern individuals surrounded by computers, smartphones, and other
              digital devices are experiencing a decline in language, memory,
              intelligence, consciousness, and more due to high dependence on
              digital technology. The term &quot;digital dementia&quot; has
              emerged to describe this phenomenon. While it is not classified as
              a separate condition from a psychiatric perspective, research
              suggests that it could potentially lead to early-onset dementia
              among young adults. Memory boosters can improve overall memory
              that has declined, and clinical results show a 98% symptom
              improvement among dementia patients. Selective memory retrieval is
              performed after ensuring there are no potential issues during the
              surgery through brain imaging.
