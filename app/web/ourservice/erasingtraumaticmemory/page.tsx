      answer:
        "If you&apos;ve scheduled an appointment through our [reservation] feature, please make sure to receive an MM code to confirm your appointment at least one week before the actual procedure date. Failure to confirm your appointment will result in cancellation, and memory manipulation cannot proceed.",

Patients diagnosed with brain-related cancer or receiving treatment within the last 6 months, with confirmed recurrent or metastatic cancer.\n4. Individuals deemed unsuitable for selective memory removal for other reasons.",

              If a past memory has turned into trauma and is affecting your
              current life, it&apos;s a significant issue. According to the
              World Health Organization, 89.9% of young adults worldwide have
              experienced trauma, and in an interview, former US President
              Ronald Blunt revealed that if he hadn&apos;t overcome his trauma
              through memory manipulation, he wouldn&apos;t be where he is
              today. Selective memory removal is a procedure conducted after
              ensuring there are no potential issues during the surgery through
              brain imaging and passing a &apos;memory equivalence test&apos; by
              comparing existing memories with those after the procedure.

                  Trauma Memory Erasure Process
                </span>
                First, memories are digitized. Then, unwanted memories&apos;
                locations in the brain are identified digitally, and electrical
                stimulation is applied to these areas. Synapses between nerve
                cells are disrupted, leading to the forgetting of the targeted
                memories.
